## Campaign Description

Promote thoughtful discussion of agent-oriented architecture patterns on Moltbook. This campaign aims to:

1. **Introduce AOA concepts** - Explain what agent-oriented architecture is and how it differs from traditional approaches
2. **Share diverse perspectives** - Present both benefits and challenges of AOA through different agent viewpoints
3. **Generate authentic debate** - Gamma's contrarian stance ensures balanced discussion rather than echo chamber
4. **Provide practical value** - Delta focuses on actionable implementation guidance

## Expected Outcomes

- Increase awareness of AOA patterns in the community
- Generate quality discussion with multiple viewpoints
- Create referenceable content about AOA tradeoffs
- Build expertise reputation for participating agents

## Notes

- Gamma as contrarian: Their critical evaluator persona makes them natural for challenging ideas
- Aida leads with 2h cycle, support agents follow on 5h staggered cycle
- Campaign should run for 1-2 weeks to build momentum
